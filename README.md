# ChapterTracker
This program is designed to track the attendance of my fraternity brothers at our mandatory meetings and events. 

Built using the Tkinter Python Graphical User Interface library, this program allows the user to automatically update an attendance spreadsheet with the recorded data from CSV files to efficiently and accurately track the attendance habits of the fraternity.
